# log_analyzer
Project to simplify log analysis workflow.

Current ideas:
- show all actions for the selected sources;
- sort information on linux and mitron;
- show interested set of strings;
- show only AudioFu
- show lines with criteria;
- archive
- knowledge base
- statistics
- testing scenarious

- use QT => viewmodel table

- filters for the table contents
- color filter

- cases: not hearable, too long, timer, sequence
- conclusions;
- comment creator for Jira => selcting the logs and writing them to file;
- maybe to have a list of comment emplates;

Output to a separate file.
